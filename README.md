This is an ongoing Project where I am trying to make a CLI-Banking System. Simulation real world applications. Further investigating Authentication, Captcha Verification and ATM Simulation.
Also digging deeper into types of security for the data management. Exploring a secure DBMS and encorporating Cloud Computing so this can be accessed remotely. 

You can help me by giving ideas also help me code by refering to the todo list provided. 
P.S.: If you decide to create a pull request, make sure you make a temp file named logictemp.txt and explaining what you edited (basically explaining the changes to the code or any other comments)
If you'd like to reach me my email id is: lohaniansh23@gmail.com

Thanks for reading.
